# Sequential-Model-Based-Optimization
This is the first assignment of the course *Automated Machine Learning*

In this assignment, we implemented an instantiation of Bayesian Optimization, in particular Sequential Model-based Optimization (SMBO).

*assignment.py* contains the implementation of SMBO, while experiments are conducted in *experiments.py*. *test.py* is a file with unit tests.
